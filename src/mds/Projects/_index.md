# Managing Projects in Dexter

Projects in Dexter serve as containers for your research activities. They encapsulate everything from study designs,
data extractions, descriptive statistics, to the outcomes of automated analytics for specific research questions.

## Creating a Project

To create a New Project

-   Go to the `My Projects` tab on the left-hand Menu.
-   Click the `NEW PROJECT` button.
-   In the dialog that appears, provide a meaningful name for your project. Use only alphanumeric characters and
    underscores (e.g., ResearchStudy_2024).

Upon creation, your project will be listed under the My Projects page, where you can manage and collaborate on various
research activities.

## Finding, Filtering and Accessing Projects and Studies

Use the Search bar in the `My Projects` page to find your projects or studies within the projects. Click on a project
card to open it and access its details and functionalities.

You can also filter your projects based on whether they are currently active or archived, or view all of them together.

## Project Collaboration

### Adding Team Members

Projects are designed for collaboration. You can add any registered Dexter user to your project at any time.

To add users, navigate to the `TEAM` tab within your project and click `ADD USERS`. Select users and their roles, then
confirm by clicking `ADD USERS` again.

### Role Management

As the project owner, you have the authority to change team members' roles, ensuring the right people have the
appropriate access levels.

## Conducting and Managing Studies

### Starting New Studies

To perform a new study, click the `EXTRACT DATA` button within your project. Select the study design that best answers
your research question.

### Study Management

The project interface includes a table of all studies, showing names, status, and author. From here, you can manage
studies by viewing summaries, downloading datasets (if you have permission), or archiving studies.

### Project Maintenance

**Archiving Projects**

As a project owner, you can archive the project and its contents from the `MANAGE PROJECT` tab. This action will
preserve your data in back-end systems.

**Transferring Ownership**

Ownership can be transferred to another team member through the `MANAGE PROJECT` tab. After selecting a new owner and
confirming, you will become a co-owner, ensuring participation in the project.
