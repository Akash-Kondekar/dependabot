# Study Protocol Management in Dexter

Study Protocols are a fundamental component of observational research and epidemiology. This documentation explains what
study protocols are, why they're important, and how to use the new Study Protocol Management feature in Dexter.

## What is a Study Protocol?

A Study Protocol is a comprehensive document that outlines the plan for a research study. It serves as a blueprint for
conducting research, ensuring consistency and adherence to scientific standards. A well-constructed protocol helps
researchers:

- Achieve reproducible results
- Address ethical considerations
- Produce findings that can contribute reliably to public benefit

In Dexter, for most database studies a pre-approved Study Protocol is a must. These documents provide the ethical and
scientific seals of approval under which users can perform full database studies. A protocol may be approved for:

- Multiple studies across various databases
- Specific studies on restricted databases

## Adding your approved protocol to Dexter

To access the study protocol management section, click on "Study Protocols" in the navigation sidebar, this component
helps you view and manage existing protocols under your account or add new ones when required.

### Adding a New Protocol

To upload a new study protocol:

1. Click the "Add New Protocol" tab within the Study Protocols section
2. Fill in the required title field (max 255 characters)
3. Optionally add a description (max 1000 characters)
4. Upload a PDF file by clicking the upload area
5. Click "Upload Protocol" to submit

When uploading a protocol, keep in mind:

- Only PDF files are accepted
- Maximum file size is 3MB
- Title field is required and description is optional

### Viewing Protocols

When you first access the Study Protocol section, you'll see the "View Protocols" tab with a list of all your protocols.
This table provides:

- **Search**: Search for particular protocols by their title using the search box provided in the table
- Protocol titles and descriptions
- File information (name and size)
- Creation dates
- Action buttons for each protocol

#### Actions

For each protocol, you can:

- **View Details**: Click the eye icon to see full protocol information
- **Download**: Click the download icon to get the PDF file
- **Archive**: Click the trash icon to archive the protocol (requires confirmation), might not be possible if it is
  linked to a study.

## How to link a Protocol to a Study on Dexter

When you are ready to perform your study on the full database, open the project under which the study exists. Locate the
study and click on the `more actions` icon and in the following menu click on `Full DB Request` button.

#### Full DB Request

The `Full DB Request` button, opens a dialog box which displays all the study protocols you have uploaded to the
system (the interface is similar to that described in `Viewing Protocols` section above). You now need to select the
appropriate protocol under which you want to perform the study. Once you select and submit your request, a member of our
team will go through your study design
and the linked protocol and take appropriate action on your request.

#### Managing/viewing the request

Once you have requested a full database extraction using a protocol, you can view its status by locating the study
within the appropriate project, and click on the `more actions` icon and in the following menu and select
`Manage protocol for this study` button. This will open a dialog box which shows an audit record of when you requested
the full database extraction, which protocol was used, and a timeline of various actions undertaken on its approval
process. If a full database request is not yet processed, it maybe possible to cancel it or replace the protocol using
which the original request was made
