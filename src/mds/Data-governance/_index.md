# Databases and Governance

## Available Databases

Dexter collaborates with various data suppliers to provide convenient access to Electronic Health Records (EHR)
databases for research purposes. Access to specific databases on Dexter requires prior agreement through a legal
contract between your institution and both Dexter and the data supplier. Only individuals named in these contracts will
be granted access to Dexter and the corresponding data.

It is crucial to ensure that you have the appropriate legal rights to access the data. Licenses often cover only paid
staff members of your institution, including full-time researchers and PhD candidates. If you are an associate staff
member, a contingent worker, or belong to any other category not explicitly covered, the Dexter license and/or data
access license may not apply to you. Should you have any doubts about your eligibility due to your current role,
upcoming changes, or recent developments, please contact us before using Dexter. We advise against using Dexter until we
can confirm your rightful access.

## Usability and Data Governance

Conducting research involving human participants mandates ethical and scientific approval from Research Ethics
Committees (RECs). The ethical review process is essential to ensure that research is conducted with integrity, rigor,
transparency, respect, and safeguards participant data. Obtaining this approval demonstrates compliance with accepted
ethical standards in research.

Before initiating any studies using Dexter, make sure you have secured the necessary ethical and scientific approval
from the relevant research governance committee. Data providers often have their own RECs for this purpose. We recommend
visiting the data vendor’s website for instructions on applying for ethical and scientific approval for your research.
All research conducted with Dexter's resources must have prior authorisation from the appropriate research governance
committee.
